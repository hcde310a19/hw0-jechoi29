# Description of your program (part 7)
An English description of instructions for counting the number of words in a document:
1. Start at the beginning of the document.
2. Initialize the word count to zero.
3. Go through individual characters (letters and whitespaces) one by one.
    - If the character in front (or after) of the character you are looking at is a whitespace, increase the word count by one.
    - If the character in front (or after) of the character you are looking at is a letter, do not increase the word count by one.
4. Continue this process (repeat Step 3) until you reach the end of the document.
5. If the character at the end of the document is a letter, increase the word count by one.


# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
# Was the previous exercise easy or hard for you? What was satisfying or unsatisfying about trying to describe the instructions in English?
# Also, it would help us if you would take a few sentences tell us what you want to get out of the course.
I thought the exercise was not too easy or hard. It took some time to get my brain going.
It got me thinking of how I would be able to approach this problem through code. I asked questions like "how do I know if this is a word"?
I reasoned different cases and conditions, as I wrote the instructions, to verify whether I was solving the problem.
It was satisfying to describe the instructions in English because I saw that it could be translated directly into code.
And, it was good to practice this problem in English to understand the reasoning and steps behind the code.
From this course, I would like to increase my technical skills so that I could further understand the possibilities of designed technology.
I want to answer something meaningful with code by manipulating data and information.
